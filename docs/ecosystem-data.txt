Here is the interpretation of colors/shapes/lines:

 - dotted line :: this step is missing and needed.

 - dashed line :: this step exists but is not captured so that anyone
   can perform it.

 - solid line :: this step exists, documented to some extent and anyone
   can reproduce it (eg, it's in GitHub).

 - yellow :: this process exists but is not generally known/available.

 - red :: this process does not exist or is just conceptual and is
   needed soon.

 - "folder" shape :: some file or file types

 - "component" shape :: some software package

 - "rectangle" shape :: a program

 - "trapezoid" shape :: visualization or end-user application
